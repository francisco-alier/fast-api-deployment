## Project3 - using FastAPI to deploy a Machine Learning Model
This is the repository for project #3 of the udacity nanodegree for Dev Ops Engineering. It involved several steps:


* Train a ML model on a classification task to predict sand if it is over 50k. It is a classification task
* Expose the model for inference using a FastAPI app
* Deploy the app using Render
* Implement Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment workflow using Github actions, github repository and Heroku integration with Github. The app is only deployed if integrated, automated, tests are validated by Github actions upon modifications
